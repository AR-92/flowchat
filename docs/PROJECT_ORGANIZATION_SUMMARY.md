# Project Organization Summary

## Clean Root Directory Structure

The root directory has been successfully organized into a clean, professional structure:

```
/home/rana/Documents/Projects/ws/
├── .gitignore            # Git ignore file
├── docs/                 # Documentation files
├── scripts/              # Utility scripts
├── src/                  # Source code
├── tests/                # Test suite
├── .git/                 # Git repository
├── node_modules/         # NPM packages
├── jest.config.js        # Jest configuration
├── package.json          # NPM package configuration
