# Asset Loading Issue Resolution

## Problem Summary

The 404 errors for assets (CSS, JS, images) were occurring because the Python HTTP server was running from the wrong directory.

## Root Cause

When the server was running from `/home/rana/Documents/Projects/ws/src/pages`, the relative paths in the HTML file like `../assets/css/inline-styles.css` were resolving incorrectly:

- Server directory: `src/pages/`
- Relative path: `../assets/css/inline-styles.css`
- Resolved path: `src/assets/css/inline-styles.css` (incorrect from `src/pages/`)

## Solution

Changed the server to run from the project root directory (`/home/rana/Documents/Projects/ws`):

```bash
cd /home/rana/Documents/Projects/ws && python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Now the relative paths resolve correctly:

- Server directory: project root (`/home/rana/Documents/Projects/ws`)
- Relative path: `../assets/css/inline-styles.css` (from `src/pages/index.html`)
- Resolved path: `src/assets/css/inline-styles.css` (correct from project root)

## Verification

Tested that assets are now accessible:

- HTML page: http://localhost:8000/src/pages/
- CSS file: http://localhost:8000/src/assets/css/inline-styles.css
- JS file: http://localhost:8000/src/assets/js/svg-loader-static.js
- Image file: http://localhost:8000/src/assets/images/Gradient.png

## Additional Improvements

1. **Professional Test Suite**: Created well-organized test structure in `/tests/`
2. **Comprehensive Asset Validation**: Tests verify all asset files exist
3. **Path Resolution Testing**: Ensures correct relative path usage
4. **Framework Migration Analysis**: Helps with CSS framework transitions

## Next Steps

1. Add the 3 missing image files:
   - `src/assets/images/mobile-agent.png`
   - `src/assets/images/mobile-collab.png`
   - `src/assets/images/mobile-infra.png`

2. Continue using the professional test suite to validate changes
3. Access the site at http://localhost:8000/src/pages/
