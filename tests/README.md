## Test Organization Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Tests are organized by type (unit, integration, e2e)
2. **Clear Naming**: Test files use descriptive names that indicate their purpose
3. **Focused Tests**: Each test file has a specific, well-defined scope
4. **Consistent Structure**: All tests follow the same organizational pattern
5. **Professional Standards**: Follows industry best practices for test organization

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests

Located in `/tests/unit/`, these tests validate individual components in isolation:

- **asset-validation.test.js**: Validates that all referenced assets (CSS, JS, images) exist
- **path-resolution.test.js**: Ensures asset paths are correctly structured

### Integration Tests

Located in `/tests/integration/`, these tests validate how components work together.

### End-to-End Tests

Located in `/tests/e2e/`, these tests validate complete user workflows.

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run specific test file
npm test tests/unit/asset-validation.test.js
```

## Test File Structure

Each test file follows this structure:

1. **Import dependencies**
2. **Describe block** for the test suite
3. **Before hooks** for setup
4. **Individual test cases** with clear descriptions
5. **Assertions** that verify expected behavior

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **DRY Principle**: Shared setup code is in helper files
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each test file has one clear purpose
3. **Descriptive Names**: Test names clearly indicate what is being tested
4. **Proper Assertions**: Tests use appropriate matchers for validation
5. **Clean Setup/Teardown**: Tests don't leave side effects
