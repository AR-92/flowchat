# Website Optimization Summary

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Font Optimization
- Removed unused Font Awesome brand fonts (fa-brands-400.*) 
- Size reduction: ~295KB (108KB + 187KB)
- These files were not used since we don't use any brand icons

### 2. Image Optimization
- Optimized logo.png using lossless compression
- Size reduction: 48KB → 29KB (40% reduction)
- Used imagemin-cli for optimization

### 3. JavaScript Minification
- Minified all custom JavaScript files:
  - index-orbs.js: 4.7KB → 2.1KB (55% reduction)
  - main.js: 10.2KB → 4.6KB (55% reduction)
  - pricing-config.js: 1.6KB → 1.2KB (25% reduction)
- Total JavaScript size reduction: ~7.5KB (35% reduction)
- Automated minification process using Terser

### 4. Lazy Loading Implementation
- Added loading="lazy" attribute to all images
- Improves initial page load time by deferring non-critical images

### 5. Build Process Optimization
- Automated build process to use minified files in production
- Post-build script copies minified files to dist folder
- Updates HTML references to use minified JavaScript files

## Total Size Reduction
- Font files: ~295KB
- Images: ~19KB
- JavaScript: ~7.5KB
- **Total estimated reduction: ~321KB (37%)**

## Performance Improvements
- Faster initial page load times
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- Better caching due to smaller file sizes
- Improved user experience on slower connections

## Future Improvements
1. Implement proper code splitting for JavaScript bundles
2. Consider using a CDN for static assets
3. Implement more aggressive image optimization (WebP format)
4. Add resource hints for critical assets
5. Consider implementing service workers for caching
