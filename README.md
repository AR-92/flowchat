## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the Tailwind CSS:
```bash
npm run tailwind
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:3000` with hot reloading.

## Alternative Development Setup

You can also use the simple Express server:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the Tailwind CSS:
```bash
npm run tailwind
```

3. Start the Express server:
```bash
npm run server
```

This will start a server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Production Build

To create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized files in the `dist/` directory.

To preview the production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Partials System

This project uses a partials system to ensure consistency across all pages and reduce code duplication. The partials are located in the `partials/` directory and include:

- **header.html** - Navigation bar and brand identity
- **footer.html** - Footer with company information, links, and copyright
- **scripts.html** - Common JavaScript code used across all pages
- **background.html** - Background elements and accessibility skip link

Each page includes these partials to maintain a consistent look and feel throughout the site.

## HTMX Integration

All pages include the HTMX library for dynamic interactions without writing custom JavaScript. This enables features like form submissions, content loading, and UI updates with minimal code.

## SEO Optimization

The site includes proper meta tags, a sitemap.xml file, and a robots.txt file to help search engines index the content effectively.

## Tailwind CSS

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The configuration is in `tailwind.config.js` and the input file is `assets/css/input.css`. The output file `assets/css/output.css` is generated by Tailwind and included in all HTML files.
